## 🛠️ Development Steps

### 1. Console Version

  - Keep track of scores until one
 
### 2. Adding the UI

- Built a simple interface using HTML and CSS
- Replaced console inputs with button clicks
- Added real-time score tracking and round results
- Included a reset feature for replaying the game

### 3. Publishing It

- Uploaded the project to GitHub
- Published it using GitHub Pages so others can play online
